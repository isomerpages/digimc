#### 1. General

1.1. These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of our services, including

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li>1.1.1. the application (whether as software or as a website or otherwise, including its contents and all push notifications); and</li>
  <li>1.1.2. all other accompanying materials.</li>
</ul>

as identified in the Schedule below (collectively, the "Service").

1.2. The Service is a Government of Singapore ("Government") digital service.

1.3. By accessing or using any part of this Service, you unconditionally agree and accept to be legally bound by these Terms of Use (including its Schedule) and any amendments thereto from time to time ("Terms of Use"). The Government reserves the right to change these Terms of Use at its sole discretion and at any time. You should read the Terms of Use carefully each and every time you access or use any part of this Service as such access or use will constitute your agreement to the Terms of Use and any amendments to it.

1.4. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, please do not use this Service or any part of this Service.

#### 2. Nature of Service

Please see the Schedule for more information and terms concerning this Service.

#### 3. Licence Terms and Restrictions

3.1. The Service, including the materials made available on or through the Service, is owned by, licensed to, managed or controlled by the Government. Please see Clause 4 (Third Party Materials) for more information.

3.2. Subject to these Terms of Use, the Government grants to you a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to access and use the Service for personal or internal purposes only. You shall not, amongst other things, modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, adapt, publish, redistribute or sublicense the Service or any part of the Service without the prior written consent of the Government or the respective third party owners. You also shall not use the Service in violation of any applicable laws or agreements that you have with any third parties or bypass any security mechanisms in the Service.

3.3. The Government reserves the right to:

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li>3.3.1. Update or modify this Service from time to time;</li>
  <li>3.3.2. Deny or restrict access to or use of the Service by any particular person without ascribing any reasons whatsoever; and</li>
  <li>3.3.3. Discontinue this Service at any time without notice or liability to you whatsoever, whereupon all rights granted to you hereunder shall also  terminate forthwith. You shall further upon notice from the Government return or  destroy all copies of the Service or materials therein that you may have downloaded.</li>
</ul>

3.4. You will not interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or otherwise do anything that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on servers used by the Government, whether owned by GovTech or otherwise.

#### 4. Third Party Materials

4.1. The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services of a third party ("Third Party"). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service (the "Third Party Terms") that will be applicable to you. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind the Government as a developer or user of the distribution platform (the "Distribution Terms"). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms.

4.2. It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date versions of these Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have notice of the same. In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms that the Government (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to you as the end user.

4.3. If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third Party Terms. For the avoidance of doubt:

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li>4.3.1.  some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit either a direct licence to you from the Third Party or a sublicence from the Government to  you. In such cases, your licence is a direct licence from the Third Party to you; and</li>
  <li>4.3.2. the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your use of the relevant third party software or service, and not these Terms of Use.</li>
</ul>

4.4. Without prejudice to Clause 4.2, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require the Government to incorporate certain terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms described in Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the "Incorporated Terms"). Examples of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require the Government to give you notice of certain rights and liabilities or require the Government to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters.

4.5. Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require the Government to grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you.

4.6. For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases the liability of the Government beyond that stated in Clause 6.

#### 5. Your Consent to Access Functions of Your Device

Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service to certain functions of your device, such as push notifications, the obtaining and/or sharing of your location, or the collection of data from you in connection with the Service. Please also see Clause 8 (Privacy Policy). Your use of the Service shall constitute your consent to the access by the Service of such functions of your device as may be reasonably required by the Service.

#### 6. Disclaimers and Indemnity

6.1. The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Government does not make any representations or warranties of any kind whatsoever in relation to the Service and hereby disclaims all express, implied and/or statutory warranties of any kind to you or any third party, whether arising from usage or custom or trade or by operation of law or otherwise, including but not limited to any representations or warranties:

</ul>

6.3. Insofar as the Service facilitates or requires the provision, use or functioning of, or is provided in conjunction with, other products, software, materials and/or services not provided by the Government, the Government makes no representation or warranty in relation to such products, software, materials and/or services (including without limitation any representation or warranties as to timeliness, reliability, availability, interoperability, quality, fitness for purpose, non-infringement, suitability or accuracy).

6.4. You shall not rely on any part of the Service to claim or assert any form of legitimate expectation against the Government.

6.5. You agree to defend and indemnify and keep the Government and its officers, employees, agents and contractors indemnified against all liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including legal costs on an indemnity basis) howsoever arising out of or in connection with your access or use of the Service (including third party software or services) or your non-compliance with the Terms of Use, Third Party Terms or Incorporated Terms, whether or not you had been advised or informed of the nature or extent of such liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses.

#### 7. Hyperlinks

7.1. Insofar as the Service provides a hyperlink to material not maintained or controlled by the Government, the Government shall not be responsible for the content of the hyperlinked material and shall not be liable for any damages or loss arising from access to the hyperlinked material. Use of the hyperlinks and access to such hyperlinked materials are entirely at your own risk. The hyperlinks are provided merely as a convenience to you and do not imply endorsement by, association or affiliation with the Government of the contents of or provider of the hyperlinked materials.

  <li>7.3.2. to disclaim responsibility and/or liability for materials that link to or frame  any part of the Service.</li>
</ul>

#### 10. Assignment

10.1. You may not assign or sub-contract these Terms of Use without the prior written consent of the Government.

10.2. The Government may assign, novate, transfer, or sub-contract the rights and liabilities in respect of the Service and these Terms of Use, without notifying you and without further reference to you.

11.3. The Government may, at its sole discretion, refer any dispute referred to in Clause 11.2 above to arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC") in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC ("SIAC Rules") for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this Clause 11.3.
